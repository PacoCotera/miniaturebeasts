# Companion species tokens (C0), on the core 48

These replace the page's code-drawn creatures: `buildCreature` gives the 32 px token in each pose, and `i-mini` gives the 12 px mini. Each species takes its canon from its signed juvenile stand-in on the Station, so the Companion and the Station show the same animal. S01 is the charcoal Loika, regraded to Pip.

- `tools/build-species-token.py STAND SPECIES OUT [--flip]` makes the base for each species' idle and mini:
  - the stand reduced once by area;
  - each part (body, cream, crest, eyes) snapped to its own core-48 ramp by value;
  - the eye placed from the stand's own eye;
  - one ink outline round the silhouette (the crest outlined in pine), never void.
- The other poses (alert, flee, huddle, shake, eat; for S03 also curl, settle, nest and glow) are drawn from the idle and hand-cleaned by the pixel artist.
- All of it is candidate until the art director signs each master at 1× on a field capture beside the pawn.

**S01 status:** the idle and the mini are a base only.
- The cream needs a shade step under the belly.
- The muzzle needs one clear line.
- The mini needs the crest kept and the body shape simplified.
